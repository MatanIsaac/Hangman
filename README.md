### <div align="center">Brief Description of the Project </div>
   
Developed over a few weeks as a side project while pursuing my Computer Science studies.

### <div align="center">The Game Objective</div>

A simple remake of the hangman game, pick a subject, guess correctly and continue to the next word
guess wrong 6 times and you lose and have to restart the game.

### <div align="center">Libraries Used</div>

The libraries comes with the project so no need to download them yourself.


Included in the repo:
* SDL2 library
* SDL2 extensions: SDL2_image, SDL2_mixer, SDL2_ttf
* OpenGL Mathematics (GLM) library
* SDL_FontCache

### <div align="center">Building from Source</div>

This project is primarily developed using Visual Studio Code and a simple makefile. 
If you're working with a different IDE, you might need to adjust the setup to compile and run the game. 

### <div align="center">Prerequisites</div>

Before building and running this project, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed and configured on your system:

* GCC Compiler: You need a working GCC compiler. It is often used with MinGW on Windows for building cross-platform applications.
* GNU Make: Ensure that make is installed on your system. This is usually included with MinGW, but if it's missing, you can install it separately.

SDL2, its extensions, and glm are included already, so there's no need to download them.

### <div align="center">Build Instructions</div>

* Open The Command Prompt
* Navigate to Project Directory
* Run make

To Play the Game:
* Windows - Simply Enter 'run'
