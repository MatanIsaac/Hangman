### <div align="center">Brief Description of the Project </div>
   
Developed over a few days as a side project while pursuing my Computer Science studies.

I chose to use the GLM library for 2D vector manipulation for its ease of use, although it might seem a bit of an overkill for a simple game.
SDL2 and its extensions, SDL2_image,SDL2_ttf


<div align="center">    
The Game Objective, and Gameplay Mechanics
</div>

    A simple remake, destroy all the asteroids to win, if you get hit by an asteroid you lose. 
    accelerate with the 'UP' key and rotate with 'LEFT' 'RIGHT, Press 'SPACE' to shoot bullets.
